		<h2><font face="Monospace" size=6> About This Project </font> </h2>
		<font face="Verdana" size=4>
			<p>  This project forms part of my Grade 12 IEB CAT task. It is focused on exploring the world of smart wearable technologies. 
			It presents data and analysis gathered during the course of this project using tools such as Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and HTML. </p>
		
			<p> The core purpose of the project is to investigate how smart wearables are being used today and to how factors like functionality, cost, user experience, and innovation influence each devices development and adoption
			The research includes a structured survey, detailed comparisons of popular devices, and visual data analytics. </p>
		
			<p> This site acts as the central hub for accessing all the data and files within this PAT and aims to make the findings accessible, easy to understand, and useful for anyone interested in wearable technology,
			Whether you're a casual user or enthusiast. It brings together real-world data and emerging trends to highlight both the potential and challenges of wearable technology today. </p>

		<h2><font face="Monospace" size=6> My Self-Evaluation </font> </h2>
			<font face="Verdana" size=4>
				<p> Completing this CAT PAT has been a challenging but rewarding experience. Through the different phases I developed a better understanding of smart wearables, 
				their current uses, and which factors can influence their adoption as well as developed a better understand in all in the packages I used to complete this project. 
				I also improved my skills in planning, collecting data, analyzing information, and presenting it using different form. </p>
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> What I Did Well: </font> </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> I successfully made a survey to collect meaningful data. </li>
				<li> I organized and analysed the data using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access. </li>
				<li> I created a structured and informative HTML website to present everything I have done in a clean and user-friendly way. </li>
				<li> I used all the required software effectively and integrated them to answer my key question. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> What I Could Improve: </font> </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> I could have managed my time much more effectively by completing task earlier and prioritising certain things. </li>
				<li> I found that creating navigation in HTML can be a bit confusing at first and Iâ€™ll practice more of this. </li>
				<li> I saw that I could be more consistent with naming methods across different files to help avoid confusion. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> What I Learned: </font> </h3>
			<ul>
				<li> I learned how to use databases to extract valuable information through queries and reports. </li>
				<li> I improved my ability to create professional and visually engaging documents and websites. </li>
				<li> I developed some critical thinking skills by interpretating survey results. </li>
			</ul>
