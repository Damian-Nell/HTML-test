		<h2> <font face="Monospace" size=6> <u> Cost VS Value</u> </font> </h2>
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> General Overview </font> </h3>
			<font face="Verdana" size=4>
				<p> To evaluate the value of various smart wearable devices, an Access report was created from an Access query to compare the average price against the accuracy rating for budget, 
				midrange, and high-end devices (with a focus on smart watches). Devices like the Garmin Fenix 7 pro and Apple Watch Ultra 2 stand out at the top end, 
				offering perfect accuracy ratings of 5/5 but at a high average price of R24000. In contrast, 
				more affordable devices such as the Fitbit Inspire 3 and Galaxy Fit 3 (2024) come in with average prices below R3500 but have much lower accuracy ratings of 2. 
				The Fitbit Charge 6 and Garmin Forerunner 55 strike a nice middle ground, offering a nice balance between accuracy (rating of 3) and moderate pricing around R5000. </p>
			</font>
		
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Good Deals </font> </h3>
			<font face="Verdana" size=4>
				<p> The Fitbit Sense 2 and Garmin Venu 3 offer a high accuracy rating (4) at a significantly lower price compared to some of the more premium models. 
				These models may offer the best value for users that want functionality without paying extra for premium features. 
				From this, we can conclude that higher cost obviously correlates with higher accuracy, but some midrange devices often offer better competitive value. </p>

		<h2> <font face="Monospace" size=6> <u> User Experience </u> </font> </h2>
			<font face="Verdana" size=4>
				<p> The survey offers some insight into how the general users will use their selected products. Across all participants, responses to questions 1-10, 
				show a generally positive experience which all questions scoring an average score of 3.5 (for agree) or higher. 
				The highest scoring questions were questions 10 and 7 with average score of 4,07 and 3,93 respectively. 
				This indicates that most users do believe that smart wearables have positively impacted their lives. </p>
				
				<p> Questions such as 1, 2 and 4 with their scores 3,86; 3,64; and 3,64 respectively, suggest that users often wear their devices and find that they have adequately helped them stay active. 
				Some slightly lower averages for questions 3 and 5 with scores of 3,50 can indicate that while users are pretty aware of their sleep patterns and actively motivated by their device, 
				these features are less impactful compared to fitness tracking. Question 9 being the lowest average which asked if the device helps prevent health issues, 
				shows that users see their devices as tracking tools rather than proactive health solutions. </p>
				
				<p> When asked about privacy, users responded with interesting results. It had a low average of 0,43 (0 for no and 1 for yes). 
				This shows that less than half of the respondents actually consider privacy as a major factor when deciding which wearable to go with. 
				This accompanying written response shows a wide variety on reasons why which range from strong privacy concerns to complete indifference. 
				This could either represent the need for clearer communication around data use by manufacturers or that people, when push comes to shove, don’t genuinely care. </p>
				
				<p> The average score for when users were 2,71 which translates to most users only needing to charge their devices a few times a week,
				which does align with the current industry standards. And lastly when asked about reliability users rated it highly with an average of 3,79, 
				confirming that users trust their devices to perform consistently. </p>
				
				<p> This data reflects that users are engaged and mostly satisfied with their devices. 
				Users often rely on their devices for fitness tracking rather than general health tracking showing there is room for improvement there, 
				either by incorporating new meaningful features or creating awareness of what is possible. </p>

		<h2> <font face="Monospace" size=6> <u> The Limitations </u> </font> </h2>
		
			<p> While smart wearables have been widely praised for their convenience and health-tracking features, 
			both survey data and research reveal that there are several limitations that can impact a device’s long-term effectiveness and adoption.</p>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Battery Life </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> This is often one of the most critical issues. From the survey in question 13, the average response was 2.71 indicating that most users charge their devices between everyday and a few times a week. 
					The frequent need for charging can become a huge inconvenience, especially for those that rely on continuous tracking throughout day and night. 
					Devices with shorter battery life also tend to rank lower on reliability scores, which can lead to an overall reduced trust and eventual disengagement from usage. </p>
				</font>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> User Drop-off </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Another major challenge is the long-term user engagement. Several industry sources and survey feedback suggest that after the initial excitement wears off, 
					many users often find themselves not wearing their devices anymore because of the combined effects of charging needs, discomfort, and/or lack of perceived value. 
					The device’s usability and motivation are major areas for improvements. </p>
				</font>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Accuracy and Sensor Limitations </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Many consumer grade wearables still struggle with accuracy, especially for users with darker skin tones, tattoos, or excessive sweat and for devices needing to be thinner and smaller after each iteration. 
					In the survey, question 9 asked about how the users feel that their device helps prevent health issues. This question had one of the lowest average scores (3,14), 
					indicating that users are often sceptical about the medical accuracy of these devices.</p>
				</font>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Privacy and Data Security </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Privacy is a very divided area. While most people from the survey didn’t let privacy effect their decision as much on which wearable to get. 
					Some of the written responses show that users don’t fully understand how their data is being collected but most seem to be concerned but accept it as a trade-off for the device’s functionality. 
					Some users said that they prefer brands with clear privacy policies and data encryption, while others just said that it has never mattered to them or that they just don’t think about it. 
					This can indicate that while privacy isn’t always a priority, there still needs to be some improvements for transparency regarding a user’s privacy. </p>
				</font>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Comfort, Durability, and Cost </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Lastly, device comfort and durability can also be barriers for how well a device is adopted. Users often report skin irritation, especially with bigger models, 
					and many premium devices are expensive, limiting accessibility. Cross compatibility between brands also is a huge issue that exists,
					which can frustrate users who want to use third-party apps or to switch platforms. </p>
				</font>
		
		<h2> <font face="Monospace" size=6> <u> Future Trends </u> </font> </h2>
			<p> <font face="Verdana" size=4> As smart wearables evolve, industry research and expert analysis predicts a few exciting trends. 
			The next generation of wearables is expected to focus on advanced health features, more personalisation, and seamless integration. </font> </p>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Mental Health and Emotional Tracking </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> In 2025, wearables have already begun expanding into mental health monitoring, using biometric signals to track stress levels, emotional responses, and sleep quality. 
					Future devices are expected to offer real-time mental wellness insights, such as guided breathing, mood prediction, and early indicators of burnout and/or anxiety. </p>
				</font>
				
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> AI and Predictive Health Tracking </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> AI is at the forefront of innovation in this field. AI integration allows for personalized treatment and an early detection of health risks. 
					Future wearables will likely include adaptive coaching which automatically adjusts goals based on user behaviour, rather than just static metrics. </p>
				</font>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Increased Personalization and Smart Integration </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Wearables are already become more tailored to each individual, with future designs expecting to use AI to adapt interfaces, 
					suggest health routines, and integrate more with the smart home ecosystem, voice assistants, and mobile devices. 
					Cross-compatibility is also expected to improve which will allow for smoother syncing across brands and services. </p>
				</font>
				
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> Improve Battery and Sensors </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Battery life remains one of the key limitations as seen in the survey. 
					Advancements in low-power processors, solar charging, and wireless power transfer are likely to enhance a devices longevity. 
					Meanwhile, sensors are becoming increasingly precise and non-invasive, with future versions expected to measure things like blood pressure, hydration levels, glucose and mood. </p>
				</font>
			
			<h3> <font face="Monospace" size=5> AR and VR </font> </h3>
				<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Beyond health tracking, some future wearables are expected to integrate AR and VR features. 
					Smart glasses and headset already exist but are somewhat limited in what they can offer at the moment.
					In the future they may offer immersive experiences for fitness, gaming, and remote work.</p>
				</font>
			
		<h2> <font face="Monospace" size=6> <u> Conclusion </u> </font> </h2>
			<font face="Verdana" size=4>
					<p> Smart wearable technologies today are primarily used as health and fitness companions, which help users track vital metrics such as heart rate, sleep, steps, and activity level. 
					The survey results show that users are generally happy with their devices , especially when it comes to fitness tracking and routine engagement, 
					but there are still major areas for growth in areas like preventative measures and long-term motivation. </p>
					
					<p> Functionality plays a key role in how users adopt their devices. Devices that offer meaningful, easy to use features with reliable performance tends to rate higher in user satisfaction. 
					The cost, while still a limiting factor, isn’t always proportional to a devices value. Midrange devices like the Fitbit sense 2 and Garmin Venu 3 demonstrates that high accuracy can be achieved at a lower cost. </p>
					
					<p> User perception is influenced by factors such as battery life, comfort and privacy. 
					Many of the respondents prioritize performance over data security, although privacy does remain as a slight concern. 
					Ongoing innovations such as AI integration, mental wellness tracking and AR/VR capabilities,
